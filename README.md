## Key Insights for Presentation

I am very much interest to find out what features or factors that affect a loan's outcome status?

Currently, I am looking at these features: Occupation, BorrowerStatus, IncomeRange, AvailableBankCardCredit, LoanOriginalAmount, EmploymentStatus, EmploymentStatusDuration, BorrowerRate, StatedMonthlyIncome, DebtToIncomeRatio,Term, BorrowerAPR,and LoanNumber as an index.
